The idea:

Both computers are on LAN.

Computer 1 (Victim):

Working on some server of his (A beginner learning python).

Computer 2 (Attacker):

Searches for a Computer that has a python server open, starts
an operation to inject code inside the server in order
to get backdoor access to the root of Computer 1. Using this
root access he can take important information and send it
through local LAN or to a remote server - further hiding his identity.

Bonus:

- Set up an ssh connection which fires up each time with
the computer's boot - making it possible to connect at a
different time (For example: after a restart) when its
connected to the internet.

- Hide program actions when the victim opens up Task Manager.

- Secure the entire connection process with a VPN and encryption.
