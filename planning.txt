The idea:

Both computers are on LAN (Maybe add support for different
networks later)

Computer 1 (Innocent):

Working on some server of his (A beginner learning python)

Computer 2 (Attacker):

Searches for a Computer that has a python server open, starts
an RCE operation to inject code inside the server in order
to get backdoor access to root of Computer 1, using this
root access he can take important information and send it
through local LAN or to a remote server.

Bonus:

Set up an ssh connection which fires up each time with
the computer's boot - making it possible to connect at a
different time (For example: after a restart) when its
connected to the internet.
